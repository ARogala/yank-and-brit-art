<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>Hi friend, welcome to Yank and Brit Art! I’m so glad you’re here. My name is Katie Rogala, the artist behind Yank and Brit. To learn more about me, please visit the About Me page.</p><br/>

<p>This site is not only a place to showcase my art, but also to share more insight into my creative process. Please feel free to look around and comment – I would love to get to know you better and have this site be as interactive as possible.</p><br/>

<p>First, let me tell you a little bit more about Yank and Brit Art (YaB). YaB creates unique artwork and décor for the home, specializing in nature (including animals and pet portraits) and Christian art. Yank and Brit strives to provide artwork that is both meaningful and fun — statement pieces that bring light and whimsy into the home of every customer. Yank and Brit will always go the extra mile for the customer, exemplifying stellar service, kindness, collaboration and professionalism.  You can  shop my art @ <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/yankandbritart">etsy.com/shop/yankandbritart.</a></p><br/>

<p>I bet you’re wondering where the name Yank and Brit comes from.  Well, I’m glad you asked. “Yank and Brit” refers to my grandparents, who are – you guessed it – a Yank and a Brit! They met when my grandfather was serving in England during WWII, and my grandmother became a British war bride. They have always been the biggest encouragers of my art, and so it was only natural to name this shop in their honor.</p><br/>

<p>Thanks again for visiting. Wishing you love & happiness…. and hope we can collaborate on a special piece of artwork for you or a loved one soon!</p><br/>

<p>Love, Katie xoxo</p>
