<h1>Katie Rogala founder of Yank and Brit Art</h1>

<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I have always loved art and DIY. I enjoy everything from making gifts and knickknacks for the home to upcycling vintage clothing and other items. Flea markets and secondhand stores are my happy place! I am a wife, follower of Jesus, and an animal lover.</p><br/>

<p>I am a social worker by profession, but I’ve always had a passion for art. As a child, my artwork was published as well as featured on NBC News as part of an incredible story on art therapy. The artwork featured on NBC was also part of a national exhibit which debuted at the Whitney Museum in New York City.</p><br/>

<p>So where did my shop name come from? Glad you asked. “Yank and Brit” refers to my grandparents, who are – you guessed it – a Yank and a Brit! They met when my grandfather was serving in England during WWII, and my grandmother became a British war bride. They have always been the biggest encouragers of my art, and so it was only natural to name this shop in their honor.</p><br/>

<p>Please never hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or a custom piece you’d like to work on together.</p><br/>

<p>Wishing you all things wonderful!</p><br/>

<p>Love, Katie</p><br/>
